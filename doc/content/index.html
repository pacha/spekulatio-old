<section id="claim">
    The you-cook-it-you-eat-it static site generator!
</section>

<section id="summary">
    Spekulatio is a static site generator that gives you the freedom to arrange
    your input files in any way you want, write your HTML without having to
    follow any predefined structure and create your own configuration variables
    instead of being given a long list of them.
</section>

<section id="description">
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Spekulatio uses <strong>Markdown</strong>,
        <strong>reStructuredText</strong>, <strong>JSON</strong>,
        <strong>YAML</strong> or plain <strong>HTML</strong> as content files,
        <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/"><strong>Jinja</strong></a>
        as its template engine and supports <strong><a
        href="https://sass-lang.com">SASS/SCSS</a></strong> to generate the
        styles of the site.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are plenty of static site generators out there. What makes
        Spekulatio different is that it doesn't give you instructions on how to
        build your site. Instead, it gives you a set of concepts that you can
        combine to tell <em>it</em> how to build it: <strong>input
        directories</strong>, <strong>actions</strong>,
        <strong>templates</strong> and <strong>values</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Input Directories: Choose Your Own File Structure</h3>
    <p>
        Spekulatio creates the output site by transforming the files provided in
        <strong>input directories</strong> but keeping their same file structure:
    </p>
    <div class="three-part-example">
      <img src="/static/img/home/home-input-dirs-input.png" alt="Spekulatio input directory example">
      <img src="/static/img/arrows/right.png" class="arrow arrow-right" alt="arrow right">
      <img src="/static/img/arrows/down.png" class="arrow arrow-down" alt="arrow down">
      <img src="/static/img/home/home-input-dirs-output.png" alt="Spekulatio output directory example">
    </div>

    <h3>Actions: Convert Filetypes According to Your Needs</h3>
    <p>
        You can provide multiple input directories. And you can assign
        different sets of <strong>actions</strong> (ie. transformations) to
        each one of them. For example, HTML files can be copied without transformation
        in one directory, used as content in another and as templates in a third one:
    </p>
    <div class="three-part-example">
      <img src="/static/img/home/home-actions-input.png" alt="Spekulatio actions example (input)">
      <img src="/static/img/arrows/right.png" class="arrow arrow-right" alt="arrow right">
      <img src="/static/img/arrows/down.png" class="arrow arrow-down" alt="arrow down">
      <img src="/static/img/home/home-actions-output.png" alt="Spekulatio actions example (output)">
    </div>

    <h3>Templates: Write HTML Any Way You Want</h3>
    <p>
        There's no pre-existing structure that you need to follow when writing
        your HTML. Write your <strong>templates</strong> using the <a
        href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> template engine
        without having to adapt it to how the tool expects it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Access the <code>_node</code> object to have full access to the site
        tree in memory and create links and menus automatically depending on
        the content.
    </p>
    <div class="two-part-example">
        <div class="code">{% filter escape -%}
---
_template: layout.html

Hello World
===========

This is just a sample Markdown file.
            {%- endfilter %}
        <span class="caption">index.md</span></div>
    <div class="code">{% filter escape -%}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
  </head>

  <body>
    {% raw -%}
    {{ _node.content }}
    {%- endraw %}
  </body>

</html>
    {%- endfilter %}
    <span class="caption">layout.html</span></div>
    </div>

    <h3>Values: Create Your Own Configuration Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        Spekulatio doesn't have too many configuration variables. Instead, it
        allows you to define your own <strong>values</strong> and change how
        the site is generated by your own.
    </p>
    <img id="values-tree" src="/static/img/home/home-values.png" alt="Spekulatio values example">
    <p>
        For example, you can define an <code>author</code> variable or a
        <code>show_banner</code> one at any point, and the variables are then
        recursively inherited by any descendant page or directory from that
        point on. You can also overwrite previously defined variables and alter
        their value. Then, in templates, you have <code>if</code> conditionals,
        <code>for</code> loops and other constructs to both display the values
        of those variables or to change how the site is generated.
    </p>

    <h2>Is Spekulatio for me?</h2>
    <p>
        Rumor says that there are as <a
        href="https://staticsitegenerators.net">many static site generators</a>
        as sites themselves in Internet. So, in case you're trying to figure
        out if Spekulatio is a good fit for you, here you have a quick check
        list:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Do you want a static site generator with an abundance of themes and extensions?</strong><br>
            Then Spekulatio may not be what you're looking for. There are very
            mature solutions out there with big ecosystems. Spekulatio is more
            about creating your site from the ground up. It gives you a lot of
            control at the expense of giving you pre-cooked solutions. If you
            ever found yourself fighting with other tools, spending more time
            trying to adapt them than creating your site the way you want, then
            Spekulatio could be a good option though.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do you want a static site generator that leverages the JavaScript ecosystem?</strong><br>
            There are many popular static site generators created around
            JavaScript tooling such as Node.js, React or Vue. In those cases
            you typically use JavaScript itself to configure the tool and
            create the visual components. In Spekulatio, you can, of course,
            add JavaScript to your sites, but it is designed for you to write
            good old HTML and CSS directly and provide the content in a variety
            of formats (Markdown, reStructuredText, YAML, JSON or HTML itself).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do you like small, unopinionated tools?</strong><br>
            Then Spekulatio may be for you. Its intended design is to be
            minimalistic and it tries to make as few assumptions about your
            site as possible. You can, pretty much, write your site from
            scratch: the HTML that you want, with the file structure that you
            want and the parameters that you decide to use. It doesn't give you
            much more than that tough. Under the hood, Spekulatio just
            transform files from one format to another, giving you the option
            to pass values around to parametrize the whole operation. The
            creativity part is on you.
        </li>

<article id="spekulatio-theme">
    <h2>Do I have to create all my site from scratch?</h2>
    <p>
        Not really. If you want to create something fast, drop content files
        and generate a site out of them, then you can use the built-in <a
        href="{{ get_url('spekulatio-theme') }}">Spekulatio theme</a>. When using
        it, you don't have to write your own HTML and it gives you:
        <ul>
            <li>A clean visual appearance.</li>
            <li>Responsive/Mobile layout out of the box.</li>
            <li>
                Autogenerated menus: just drop your content files and the site
                navigation will adapt automatically.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to know how it looks like, well... you're looking at it
        now. The entire Spekulatio documentation is generated using it.
