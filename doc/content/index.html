<h1>Spekulatio</h1>

<p id="claim">
    An almost totally unopinionated static site generator
</p>

<p id="summary">
    Spekulatio is a static site generator that gives you <strong>all</strong>
    the freedom. Create your HTML without having to follow any rules imposed by
    the tool. Design the file structure of your project to match your content.
    Spekulatio doesn't require a predefined set of directories such as
    <code>assets</code>, <code>static</code> or <code>posts</code>, for
    example. Also, there's no need to fit your content to a fixed content
    taxonomy: you don't have <em>posts</em>, <em>sections</em> or
    <em>subsections</em>? That's fine, the tool won't force your content into
    them... or any.
</p>

<article id="Quickstart">
    <h2>Quickstart</h2>

    <p>
    To create the smallest site possible with Spekulatio, just create a
    directory where to place your content (<code>content/</code>) and a
    directory where the result site will be generated (<code>build/</code>).
    Add also some content in Markdown format. For example:
    </p>

    <pre>
    hello-world/
        build/
        content/
            index.md
    </pre>

    <p>
    Now, just execute <code>spekulatio build</code> inside
    <code>hello-world/</code> and your brand new site will be ready:
    </p>

    <pre>
    hello-world/
        build/
            index.html
        content/
            index.md
    </pre>

    <p>
    To serve your site, execute <code>spekulatio serve</code> from the root
    directory. A HTTP server will be started and you'll be able to reach your
    converted files using any browser:
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="http://localhost:8000/index.html">http://localhost:8000/index.html</a>
    </p>

    Ok, ok, at this point your site may not look very impressive, but from here
    you can use templates to provide your HTML, add static files, define
    metadata or configure how each filetype should be processed. One advantage
    of Spekulatio is that simple things are easy to do and complex things are,
    well, not difficult either.

</article>

<article id="how-it-works">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
    The main idea behind Spekulatio is very simple. Provide a directory with
    your contents —eg. Markdown, RestructuredText, HTML, CSS or JS files— and
    Spekulatio will go over each file converting them according to their file type
    —eg. converting Markdown to HTML or compiling SCSS to CSS.
    </p>

    <p>
    The file structure of the input directories is up to you, Spekulatio will
    just generate a site that mirrors that structure using the converted files:
    </p>

    <pre>
    content/
        static/
            styles.scss
        one-section/
            page.md
        index.md
    </pre>

    <pre>
    build/
        static/
            styles.css
        one-section/
            page.html
        index.html
    </pre>

    <p>
    On top of this, Spekulatio provides several concepts that you can combine
    to create more complex sites: <em>templates</em>, <em>values</em>,
    <em>input directories</em> and <em>actions</em>.
    </p>

<section>
    <div class="concept concept-text">
        <h3>Templates</h3>
        Spekulatio supports Markdown, RestructuredText, JSON, YAML and HTML
        formats to create the HTML pages of your site. For that, it uses the
        awesome <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja template
        engine</a>. Set which template you want to use for a single content
        file of a whole section of your site and Spekulatio will render the
        final page using it.
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="concept concept-image">
        <img src="/static/img/home/input-dirs.png">
    </div>

    <div class="concept concept-text">
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>
        Spekulatio treats your site as a tree of nodes and you can set
        variables inside any node. For example, you can define <code>author:
        me</code> in one page and <code>author: you</code> in another. Which
        variables to define is up to you and, once defined, you can use them in
        templates to change how the final page is rendered or to display their
        information.
        </p>

        <p>
        More importantly, these values are inherited. For example, if you set
        <code>section: one</code> in one folder, each page that is a descendant
        to it will have access to that value. Or, for instance, if you set
        <code>site_name: foobar</code> at the root of your project, every
        single page of the site will receive this value.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept concept-text">
        <h3>Input directories</h3>
        You can pass multiple input directories to create a single site and
        Spekulatio will merge them together. This allows you to have one or
        more input directories that you can reuse across sites. Do you have a
        HTML layout and a set of CSS files that you can reuse in multiple
        projects? A <em>theme</em> in Spekulatio is not different from any
        other input directory.
    </div>

    <div class="concept concept-text">
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        You can configure which action should be performed for each file type
        in each input directory. For example, you can treat HTML files as
        <em>templates</em> in one directory and as <em>content</em> in another.
        JSON files can be used to generate HTML pages or just being directly
        copied into the output site. There are a number of actions available in
        Spekulatio, like <code>copy</code>, <code>ignore</code>, <code>use as
        template</code>, or <code>render</code> and you can decide how they are
        applied to the different file types.

    <h2>Spekulatio's Theme</h2>
    <p>
        If you just want to create a site using some content but don't want to
        define all the HTML/CSS from scratch, Spekulatio also provides a
        generic *theme* that you can use out of the box. It's clean layout and
        customization posibilities make it a good choice for those times when
        you need to create a site fast. It is responsive and it automatically
        adapts well to desktop and mobile screens.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to see how it looks like, just look at this site. It uses
        it!

<article id="who-is-spekulatio-for">
    <h2>Who is Spekulatio for?</h2>
    <p>
        There are, quite literally, hundreds of static site generators out there.
        Choosing among them can be really challenging. Spekulato can be a good fit
        if:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You don't want to fight against the tool to be able to create the exact
            HTML/CSS that you want or to define the file structure that better fits
            your project.
        </li>
        <li>
            You favor simplicity and small tools with a reduced set of combinable
            concepts over hundreds of configuration options.
        </li>
    </ul>

    On the other hand, there are tools that may be a better choice if:

    <ul>
        <li>
            You prefer bigger applications with a large plugin ecosystem.
        </li>
        <li>
            You're looking for a JavaScript based tool. There are a large number of
            static site generators that leverage the Node.js/React.js ecosystem.
            Spekulatio is not one of them though (you can add as much JavaScript as
            you want to your sites in Spekulatio, but the tool itself is language
            agnostic).
        </li>
    </ul>
