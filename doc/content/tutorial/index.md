Tutorial
========

This tutorial will guide you from how to create your first site in a few minutes
to how to apply all the more advanced options. Spekulatio is a small tool, so almost
everything you need to know to use it fits in this single page. Once you know
how the tool works, the [Reference](/reference) offers a quick way to check out
all the different options.

If you don't have Spekulatio installed in your system yet, you can also check
out the [Download](/download.html) section for information on how to install it.
