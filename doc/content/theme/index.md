Spekulatio Theme
================

Creating your own HTML for your sites is very easy with Spekulatio. However,
there are times when you just want to be able to create a site fast and not to
have to deal with creating the HTML layout and styles from scratch. The
Spekulatio Theme is an input directory that you can add to your project in that
kind of occasions. It provides:

* A clean, minimalistic look that adapts well to different kinds of site content.
* Responsive layout that adapts the content to the size of the screen.
* A two-level menu system that is generated using introspection:
  drop your content files in the project and the menus adapt automatically.
* Ways to customize colors, styles and the different HTML components of the
  page.

Themes in Spekulatio are just input directories that provide HTML templates and CSS
and JS files and work like any other input directory that you could have in your
project. That applies to the Spekulatio Theme too, which means that you can
inspect the files it adds to your build directory and override any of them from
your personal ones.

If you're wondering how it looks like, well, you're looking at it. All
Spekulatio documentation is generated using the stock version of the Spekulatio
Theme.

If you're looking for a quick way to create a site, setting one up with
Spekulatio and the Spekulatio Theme and start adding content is pretty much a
question of minutes.
